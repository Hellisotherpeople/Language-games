Dead simple games made with word vectors. 


A fun and simple 2 hour project to write games using NLP word vectors.
I have more simple game ideas which will be included in here.

The first game is about trying to choose a random word generated by the computer.
Player 1 and Player 2 take turns guessing words that they think are semantically "close" to the hidden word generated
The winner is the player with the closest word. 

At the moment, I have enabled a mode which gives you a large list of similar words in random order to help each player guess the closest word. 
This makes the game more fun and is a great use-case for running approx_nearest_neighbors (which is super fast! :) )

The computer can optionally generate either a list of random words with a handful of "golden ticket" (close words) sprinkled in 
(default is 6 golden ticket words and 50 random words) to serve as "inspiration" instead. My wife and I think that the default mode is more fun
